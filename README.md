[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lumoslabs/txdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lumoslabs/txdb)

Txdb, a mashup of "Transifex" and "database", is an automation tool that facilitates translating database content with Transifex, a popular translation management system.

### Configuration

Coming soon.

### Usage

Coming soon.

Running Tests
---

Txdb uses the popular RSpec test framework and has a comprehensive set of unit tests. To run the test suite, run `bundle exec rspec`.

Requirements
---

Txdb requires an Internet connection to access the Transifex API and some kind of database. You will configure which database to use in the configuration file.

Compatibility
---

Txdb was developed with Ruby 2.1.6, but is probably compatible with all versions between 2.0 and 2.3, and maybe even 1.9. Your mileage may vary when running on older versions of Ruby.
